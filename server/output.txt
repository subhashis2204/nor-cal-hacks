In his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and

more than $6 million to his local hospital and library.

Those who knew Read were baffled. Where did he get all that

money?

It turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and

no inheritance. Read saved what little he could and invested it

in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end, as tiny

savings compounded into more than $8 million.

That's it. From janitor to philanthropist.

A few months before Ronald Read died, another man named

Richard was in the news.

Richard Fuscone was everything Ronald Read was not. A

Harvard-educated Merrill Lynch executive with an MBA,

Fuscone had such a successful career in finance that he retired

in his 40s to become a philanthropist. Former Merrill CEO

David Komansky praised Fuscone's "business savvy, leadership

skills, sound judgment and personal integrity." Crain's business

magazine once included him in a "40 under 40" list of successful

businesspeople.2

But then-like the gold-coin-skipping tech executive-

everything fell apart.

In the mid-200os Fuscone borrowed heavily to expand an

18,000-square foot home in Greenwich, Connecticut that had II

bathrooms, two elevators, two pools, seven garages, and cost more

than $90,000 a month to maintain.

Then the 2008 financial crisis hit.

The crisis hurt virtually everyone's finances. It apparently

turned Fuscone's into dust. High debt and illiquid assets left

him bankrupt. "I currently have no income," he allegedly told a

bankruptcy judge in 2008.

First his Palm Beach house was foreclosed.

In 2014 it was the Greenwich mansion's turn.

Five months before Ronald Read left his fortune to charity,

INTRODUCTION

These soft skills are, I've come to realize, greatly underappreciated.

Finance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based field, where

you put data into a formula and the formula tells you what to do,

and it's assumed that you'll just go do it.

This is true in personal finance, where you're told to have a six-

month emergency fund and save 10% of your salary.

It's true in investing, where we know the exact historical

correlations between interest rates and valuations.

And it's true in corporate finance, where CFOs can measure

the precise cost of capital.

It's not that any of these things are bad or wrong. It's that

knowing what to do tells you nothing about what happens in

your head when you try to do it.

Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them

or not: health and money.

The health care industry is a triumph of modern science, with

rising life expectancy across the world. Scientific discoveries have

replaced doctors' old ideas about how the human body works, and

virtually everyone is healthier because of it.

The money industry-investing, personal finance, business

planning-is another story.

Finance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top

universities over the last two decades. Financial Engineering was

the most popular major in Princeton's School of Engineering a

decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors?

I have seen none.

Through collective trial and error over the years we learned

how to become better farmers, skilled plumbers, and advanced

chemists. But has trial and error taught us to become better with

our personal finances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in

debt? More likely to save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement?
